            project was created on October, 2025 and has been
            actively improved and extended since then. efs' goal
            is to bring the power of distributed, reactive events
            in a simple API, so simple that you don't notice efs
            when you transmit events within your JVM or around
            the world.

            Updated: November 11, 2025<br>Version. 0.2.0

    <h1><a id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
    <p>
      efs - Event File System is <em>envisioned</em> as a
      reliable, robust, and low-latency event persistence and
      delivery API from publishing agent to subscribing
      agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Envision" means that efs is not yet implemented to this
      point - but enough is implemented to warrant an initial
      release. The first is the dispatcher framework used to
      deliver events to agents in a virtual single-threaded
      manner. Virtual single-threading means that while an
      agent may run on different threads over its lifespan it
      is guaranteed to be accessed by only one thread at any
      given moment. This means there is no need for
      synchronization/locks which can lead to a thread losing
      core while waiting to acquire a lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second component is the activator which uses dispatcher
      to start and activate
      {@link org.efs.activator.IEfsActivateAgent activate agents}
      (an interface extension to
      {@link org.efs.dispatcher.IEfsAgent IEfsAgent})
      Activator solves the problem where an agent is activated
      on one thread where it connects into a reactive framework
      but receives events on dispatcher threads
      <em>while still activating on the original thread.</em>
      The virtual single-threading guarantee provided by
      dispatcher is lost in this scenario. Activator has agent
      activation performed by the agent's dispatcher. Any events
      posted to the agent while activating are delivered
      <em>after</em> activation is completed.

    <h2><a id="LearnEfs">Learning efs</a></h2>
    <p>
      efs package javadocs explain how to use the package
      together with example code. You are encourged to explore
      the javadoc packages in the following order:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        {@link org.efs.dispatcher dispatcher}: explains
        dispatcher architecture and how to use. Compares efs
        dispatcher with LMAX Disruptor and SEDA (staged event
        driven architecture).
      </li>
      <li>
        {@link org.efs.dispatcher.config dispatcher configuration}:
        explains how to configure dispatchers using
        <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config" target="_blank">typesafe</a>
        configuration bean classes stored in a JSON file format.
        <p>
          Please note that efs uses typesafe for all its
          configuration.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        {@link org.efs.timer timer}: contains the
        {link org.efs.timer.EfsScheduledExecutor} which
        <em>somewhat</em> follows the
        {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService ScheduledExecutorService}
        interface but does not implement that interface because
        it does not deliver expired timers using a
        {@code ScheduledFuture} but instead uses
        {@code EfsDispatcher} for delivery.
        <p>
          An efs scheduled executor may be created either
          programmatically or by typesafe configuration file.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        {@link org.efs.timer.config timer configuration}:
        explains how to define one or more efs scheduled
        executors using a typesafe configuration file.
      </li>
      <li>
        {@link org.efs.activator activator}: this service steps
        efs agents through stopped, stand by, active states in
        a thread-safe manner using efs dispatcher's virtual
        single-thread environment. User defined
        {@link org.efs.activator.Workflow workflows} provide the
        order in which efs agents are stepped through their
        states.
      </li>
      <li>
        {@link org.efs.activator.config activator configuration}:
        explains how to define one or more activation workflows
        using a typesafe configuration file.
      </li>
      <li>
        {@link org.efs.logging logging}: implements
        <a href="https://slf4j.org" target="_blank">slf4j</a>
        {@code Logger} and {@code LoggerFactory} with
        {@link org.efs.logging.AsyncLogger AsyncLogger} and
        {@link org.efs.logging.AsyncLoggerFactory AsyncLoggerFactory}.
        This logging uses efs dispatcher to perform the actual
        logging on a dispatcher thread rather than inline with
        application code.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2><a id="BackgroundEfs">efs Background</a></h2>
    <p>
      efs is a direct descendent of the 25 year old
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ebus/">eBus</a>
      project. The goal here is to tease out the best of that
      work, forming a better API using Java 21 features. This
      work is <em>not</em> a re-implementation of eBus but a step
      beyond. efs is based on the oberservation that applications
      require:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        historic events,
      </li>
      <li>
        live events, and
      </li>
      <li>
        combination of historic and live events.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      eBus started with live event distribution only. A later
      attempt to add historic events to eBus designed to fit into
      the eBus framework was less than satisfactory. Hence,
      a need for a new framework supporting both historic and
      live event distribution from the start.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designing a new efs event persistence and distribution
      API is on-going. This initial release 0.1.0 provides the
      event delivery and processing API known as Dispatcher. It
      is similar to Disruptor and SEDA (staged event-driven
      architecture) but simpler. Dispatcher is designed to be a
      stand-alone API and useful in its own right.
